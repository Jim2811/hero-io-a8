# 🚀 HERO.IO

HERO.IO is a dynamic **React-based App Store page** where all applications are displayed as interactive cards fetched from Context data.  
Users can easily **search apps by name**, and the system provides a **smooth, real-time search experience** with a loading animation while typing.  
Once the user stops typing, the app **instantly filters and displays** only the matching applications.  
The entire design is **responsive**, clean, and works efficiently **without using `useEffect`**.
